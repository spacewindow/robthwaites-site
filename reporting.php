				<p>PLAYGROUND XYZ’s offer a full-service mobile advertising platform. Advertisers can speedily design engaging mobile ads and deploy them to an array of international websites.</p>

				<p></p>

				<p>I have been lead designer for all aspects of Campaign Reporting for the Playground platform from its inception. My final contribution was a working prototype for the Reporting dashboard:
					<ul>
						<li>Conducting user research</li>
						<li>Working with the dev team on key information architecture</li>
						<li>Designing and prototyping the internal Report Builder tool</li>
						<li>Designing the Reporting and Analytics Dashboard</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>User Research</h2>

				<p>Who were our users? What questions would they need answered about their mobile advertising campaigns? And how should the data be presented to answer these questions? I exhaustively gathered user stories through discussions with clients and internal data-marketing experts, to fully understand the questions </p>

				<p>My findings were articulated as a two key personas and two seocondary personas.</p>
